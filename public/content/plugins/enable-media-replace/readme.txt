Easily replace any attached image/file by simply uploading a new file in the Media Library edit view - a real time saver!

== Description ==

**A free, lightweight and easy to use plugin that allows you to seamlessly replace an image or file in your Media Library by uploading a new file in its place. No more deleting, renaming and re-uploading files!
Supported by the friendly team that created <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/" target="_blank">ShortPixel</a>  :)**

#### A real timesaver

Don't you find it tedious and complicated to have to first delete a file and then upload one with the exact same name every time you want to update an image or any uploaded file inside the WordPress media library?

Well, no longer!

Now you'll be able to replace any uploaded file from the media "edit" view, where it should be. Media replacement can be done in one of two ways:

#### It's simple to replace a file

1. Just replace the file. This option requires you to upload a file of the same type as the one you are replacing. The name of the attachment will stay the same no matter what the file you upload is called.
1. Replace the file, use new file name and update all links. If you check this option, the name and type of the file you are about to upload will replace the old file. All links pointing to the current file will be updated to point to the new file name.

This plugin is very powerful and a must-have for any larger sites built with WordPress. It now also comes with preview of the replaced image!

#### Display file modification time

There is a shortcode available which picks up the file modification date and displays it in a post or a page. The code is:
`[file_modified id=XX format=XXXX]` where the "id" is required and the "format" is optional and defaults to your current WordPress settings for date and time format.

So `[file_modified id=870]` would display the last time the file with ID 870 was updated on your site. To get the ID for a file, check the URL when editing a file in the media library (see screenshot #4)

If you want more control over the format used to display the time, you can use the format option, so `[file_modified id=870 format=Y-m-d]` would display the file modification date but not the time. The format string uses [standard PHP date() formatting tags](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php).

* The "more reliable way" of determining MIME types turned out to be less reliable. Go figure. There seems to be no perfect way of performing a reliable check for MIME-types on an uploaded file that is also truly portable.

It is far from beautiful, so if anybody has a better way of doing it, please contact me!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin actually do? =

This plugin makes it easy to update/replace files that have been uploaded to the WordPress Media Library.

= How does it work? =

A new option will be available in the Edit Media view, called "Replace Media". This is where you can upload a new file to replace the old one.

= I replaced a file, but it didn't change! =

There are two main reasons this would happen.

First, make sure you are not viewing a cached version of the file, especially if you replaced an image. Press "Refresh" in your browser to make sure.

Second, if the file really looks unchanged, make sure WordPress has write permissions to the files in your uploads folder. If you have ever moved your WP installation (maybe when you moved it to a new server), the permissions on your uploaded files are commonly reset so that WordPress no longer has permissions to change the files. If you don't know how to do this, contact your web server operator.

== Screenshots ==

1. The new link in the media library.
2. The replace media-button as seen in the "Edit media" view.
3. The upload options.
4. Get the file ID in the edit file URL
